(2006) found that the frequency of the IL1B -31TT genotype was 0.071 compared to 0.37 as reported in Caucasians. Among the Indian population, they observed a significantly higher frequency of the IL1B -511TT genotype (OR of 4.22) and -31CC genotype (OR of 2.16) in H. pylori-infected persons with duodenal ulcer compared to infected persons with normal mucosa. The -511T/-31C haplotype was present at a higher frequency in H. pylori-infected duodenal ulcer patients than in infected controls (OR of 2.47). Carriers of the -31CC genotype had significantly lower IL1B mRNA levels in gastric mucosa compared to other genotypes, and IL1B promoter assay showed that the -31T promoter had a 10-fold increase in activity compared to -31C. Chakravorty et al. (2006) suggested that H. pylori-infected individuals with the -31CC genotype secrete less IL1B and are susceptible to duodenal ulcers. \r\n","project":"HZAU_Active_Gene_Corpus","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":100,"end":104},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":257,"end":261},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":616,"end":621},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":622,"end":626},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":627,"end":638},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":690,"end":694},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":754,"end":762},"obj":"Positive_Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":766,"end":774},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":889,"end":896},"obj":"Molecular_Physiological_Activity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":897,"end":901},"obj":"Negative_Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":902,"end":906},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"}]}
